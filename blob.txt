<sys/stat.h>
This library provides a set of functions and data structures
relating to information about files and directories.
It is commonly used in POSIX-compliant systems for file handling and metadata retrieval.

The struct stat is a structure that holds info on a file or directory.
Stuff like file type, size, permissions, ownership, and timestamps.
We use stat() to fill in this struct. 
The call looks like:
char* file_path;
struct stat directory_info;
stat(file_path, &directory_info);
stat takes in the file path, and fills in our corresponding struct with gathered info.
&directory_info is used to pass the address of the struct to be filled, if we just passed directory_info-
it would just pass a copy of the value instead of our struct. (Due to Cs pass by value)
